# Reproducible research and reproducible documents

## Stata is good at reproducible research

- Manually performed data management and analysis can be easily turned into 
  scripts (do-files) 
- Scripts from 30 years ago still run and produce the same results today and 
  will do the same in future
- Datasets created 30 years ago can be read today and in future
